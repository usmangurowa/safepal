# safepal

Basically, Safe Pal is a mobile application that can be used to report missing persons, and also Safe Pal can track it users location (with their consent) to know their whereabouts so that incase they went missing, it will be very easy to track them because Safe Pal have the necessary data for security agencies like Police to carry out investigation with.

The future plan of Safe Pal is bright, currently i am working on a new feature which i wont be able to finish due to the duration of the hackathon, this new features enable Safe Pal users to report emergency problems to near-by emergency stations like Fire Station incase of fire out break, Police stations incase of robbery, theft, etc. 

Safe Pal can make Nigerians and people all over the world to feel safe again, since they know that when they go missing, there is a sufficient information that can be used to find them.
